# python-api-challenge
In the WeatherPy, I used randomly generated geographic coordinates to study relationships between many weather variables.  I created scatter plots as well as calculated regression to see if there which variables were related.
In the VacationPy, I used GeoApify to plot every one of our cities on a map, with the size of each plot based on Humidity.  Then, I cleaned up the DataFrame by deciding on my ideal weather conditions and then tried to find Hotels within a 10,000 meter radius of each citie's geographic coordinates.  This could help me decide on planning my next vacation.
*Used Stack Overflow, Google, the Learning Assistants and a tutor to help me with this challenge.
